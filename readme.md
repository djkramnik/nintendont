try to forget I'm n years old

in my spare time I will fiddle with this thing... 

goal for this is maybe to just make a fair proximity to mario world 1-1... 
just to try out game dev, particularly platforming concepts 
and just trying to figure out things by myself as much as possible

after this is done I'll maybe look at code from other pico8 games... try to prototype something
from my natty mountain platforming idea 

## TODO


then, goomba?

* a utility that causes a value to change over a period of time, by a step or formula 
* use this utility to test out playing the squish animation for the goomba

* abstract out the way a sprite moves around the screen from player input 
* then refactor player movement to use the same abstraction as goomba
* and split out logic that deals with changing the variables to effect player movement


then, trampoline?
breakable blocks?
coin blocks? 
screen scroll?
