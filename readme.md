try to forget I'm n years old

in my spare time I will fiddle with this thing... 

goal for this is maybe to just make a fair proximity to mario world 1-1... 
just to try out game dev, particularly platforming concepts 
and just trying to figure out things by myself as much as possible

after this is done I'll maybe look at code from other pico8 games... try to prototype something
from my natty mountain platforming idea 

## TODO





we need horizontal collision detection.  and perhaps some kind of pushback
when we stop jumping, we may need to adjust ny to be ceil.  to go to the nearest smallest multiple of 8

then, hitting head on block
// can also check this whilst jumping or falling
// whilst jumping will immediately send it to falling 
// whilst 
function bustinghead(nx, ny)
  similar thing
end

then, goomba? 
then, trampoline?
